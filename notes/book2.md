## Book 2

### Title

* Captain Z and the Prince of the Sea

### Features

Carlos - Z's missing classmate - is the shadowy figure behind the attack.
Like Z, he went to pirating but fell in with an evil crew and learned secrets of
"Death Magic" - something powered by a Hades-based artifact(s). Capture of Port Goodnews is to prepare for massive sacrifice to awaken some ancient evil power - or provide massive power to him.

Capture of children was because of:

* Indiana jones style needing kids to mine for some artifact?
* Sacrifice only works with kids?
* Children are a weakness to Carlos somehow?

Perhaps each of the kids develops a special function / skill.

Carlos needs a cool scary name. "The Dark One", "The Commander", "KillGlove".

Desert dweller attack: Carlos sends a message to DDs telling them to prepare for flying ship. They have grapple guns / hookshots they use for slowing down caravans through the desert. Use them to bring down wind drinker. Wind drinker crashes into sand dunes. Z grabs the feathers - and she and the kids make a run for it - but because the others can't fly, they are trapped and captured. They are brought to a cave system in the mountains / rock cones of the desert area. There they discover another prisoner, Eli prince of the XXXX sea. (Q: if he is a mythical creature of the sea - why are mythical sea people not mentioned in first book?). Eli is close to death - due to the incompatible climate. They escape together.
